This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript closure issue that occurs when using `setTimeout` within a loop.  The problem arises because the `setTimeout` callback function does not immediately execute; it is scheduled to run later. By the time the callback functions eventually run, the loop has already completed, and the value of `i` has reached its final value (10).  Therefore, all the `console.log` statements print '10' instead of the expected sequence from 0 to 9.  The solution provides a corrected version of the code that uses closures to correctly capture the value of `i` at each iteration.
